# Feed Forward 

Feed Forward is a groundbreaking mobile application designed to combat food waste and address food insecurity. The app's primary objective is to ensure that quality food resources are not squandered by connecting individuals and NGO's with excess food to those in need of it.

One of the most salient features of Feed Forward is its donation platform, which empowers restaurants, grocery stores, and other food-related businesses to donate surplus food to nearby charitable organizations, food banks, and shelters. This feature is vital in reducing food waste and ensuring that valuable food resources are used effectively to alleviate hunger in communities.

In addition to tackling food waste, Feed Forward serves as a robust platform for addressing food insecurity. Through the app, users can request assistance with food and have their needs met by generous donors within their local communities. Further, monetary donations can be made via the app, which are then used to provide financial support to those who lack access to sufficient food resources.

By leveraging the potential of technology and community-driven efforts, Feed Forward is fully committed to minimizing food waste and guaranteeing that every individual has access to sufficient nourishment. Join us in our mission to establish a world where no one goes hungry. Along with facilitating food donations and linking people in need with donors, Feed Forward also welcomes monetary contributions. This feature enables users to make direct donations to advance the app's goal of reducing food waste and tackling food insecurity. These donations are applied towards covering operational costs, expanding the app's scope, and offering financial assistance to those in need. Every contribution made to Feed Forward enables the app to continue its critical work of making a positive impact on the lives of individuals and communities worldwide.
